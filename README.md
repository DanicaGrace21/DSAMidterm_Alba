<h1 style="color: lightpink; font-weight: bold;">What is React JS?</h1>

- React.js is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook to simplify the creation of interactive UIs using reusable components. It manages the view layer like the "V" in MVC, optimizing performance and rendering speed. By breaking down complex UIs into smaller components and using efficient DOM manipulation, React enables faster and more dynamic web applications.

<h2 style="color: lightpink; font-weight: bold;">A Brief History of React.js</h2>

In 2011, Facebook was facing the challenge of improving user experience by building a faster, more dynamic, and responsive user interface. To address this, software engineer **Jordan Walke** developed React. The library made it easier to create interactive and dynamic UIs by introducing reusable components, offering a more organized and efficient way to manage the interface. React was first implemented in Facebook’s newsfeed, where it significantly improved performance and responsiveness. Its novel approach to DOM manipulation—focusing on a virtual DOM—led to better rendering speeds and smoother user interactions. After being released as open-source, React quickly gained traction within the JavaScript community, transforming the way developers approached UI development and establishing itself as a key tool in the modern web development ecosystem.
