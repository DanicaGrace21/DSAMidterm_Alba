<h1 style="color: lightpink; font-weight: bold;">What is React JS?</h1>

- React.js is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook to simplify the creation of interactive UIs using reusable components. It manages the view layer like the "V" in MVC, optimizing performance and rendering speed. By breaking down complex UIs into smaller components and using efficient DOM manipulation, React enables faster and more dynamic web applications.

<h2 style="color: lightpink; font-weight: bold;">A Brief History of React.js</h2>

In 2011, Facebook was facing the challenge of improving user experience by building a faster, more dynamic, and responsive user interface. To address this, software engineer **Jordan Walke** developed React. The library made it easier to create interactive and dynamic UIs by introducing reusable components, offering a more organized and efficient way to manage the interface. React was first implemented in Facebook’s newsfeed, where it significantly improved performance and responsiveness. Its novel approach to DOM manipulation—focusing on a virtual DOM—led to better rendering speeds and smoother user interactions. After being released as open-source, React quickly gained traction within the JavaScript community, transforming the way developers approached UI development and establishing itself as a key tool in the modern web development ecosystem. 

<h2 style="color: lightpink; font-weight: bold;">How Does React JS Do?</h2>

- Typically, a webpage is requested by typing its URL, which sends a request to the server, and the browser renders the page.
- Each time you click a link, a new request is sent to fetch a new page, resulting in back-and-forth loading between the client and server.
- This traditional loading pattern can become redundant and lead to poor user experience, especially on data-driven websites.
- React introduces single-page applications (SPA), loading only one HTML document and updating specific sections with JavaScript, avoiding full page reloads.
- React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update and compare changes, enabling faster rendering without reloading the entire page.

- Unlike frameworks like Angular, React doesn’t enforce strict rules for code conventions or file organization, offering flexibility to developers.
- React allows developers to use as much or as little of it as needed, making it adaptable for various project sizes and needs.
- You can gradually integrate React into existing applications or use it to build fully-featured React applications from scratch.

**React is not a framework**
-- The short answer is that React is a JavaScript library, but the fact remains that it has several characteristics of a framework. It's just a library for rendering your views.
